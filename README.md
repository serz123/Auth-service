# Auth service

The auth service is responsible for handling accounts and handing out JWTs upon successful authentication.

This RESTful API is implemented to match the API documentation found at:
[https://courselab.lnu.se/picture-it/api/v1/auth/docs/](https://courselab.lnu.se/picture-it/api/v1/auth/docs/)


The JWT token that you got is utilized for authorization to access resources from the resource server.
